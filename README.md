## Overview

This project is apart of the getfit framework provided initially. We took this initial framework and
completely reworked it into our own application with its own unique features. The application is split
into multiple different pages with each page having its own features that a user can utilize.

# Pages

## Home Page

The home page is a built in Pedometer that allows the user to input a step goal. The total steps are
kept track of as well as the number of miles traveled and the amount of calories burned. To update
the step count to the user, you can pull down on the screen to refresh to step count, miles walked,
and calories burned.

## Calendar Page

The Calendar page is a calendar that allows the user to make any workout announcements which will remind
the user at the specified time set in the event.

## Calorie Counter

The Calorie Counter page allows the user to keep track of how many calories they have taken in or burned
throughout the day. The can either manually enter the calories they earned or burned or they can select
a food or exercise from a list of foods or exercises with there average calories. The foods are their 
average calorie counts where as exercises are the average amount of calories burned over 5 minutes of
that exercise.

## Workouts

The workouts page is an information page that provides pictures and descriptions of different workouts
that are separated between arm, leg, and core exercises.

## Start Workout

The start workout page is a distance/timer page that tracks the amount of distance traveled in miles 
during a workout and the amount of time taken to complete the workout. You can lap, pause, resume and 
reset the timer as needed. 

## Video Guides

The Video Guides page is a page with numerous videos showcasing video demonstrations of how the workouts
are performed. This is for if the pictures or descriptions on the workouts page aren't enough for the user
and want a visual showcase of how it is performed.

## WorkOut Schedule

The workout schedule page is a page with a pre made schedule of workouts to perform throughout the week
Monday to Friday. The workout schedule is also broken up by category so there is a schedule for arms, 
legs, and core. So the user can select a specific regional workout or can mix and match what they do
for themselves. There is also a button that brings the user to the Workouts tab if they need information
on the specific workouts in question.

## Announcements

The Announcements page allows users to receive notifications from admins. Admins would be the leader
of workout groups or personal trainers who can send notifications to any member of there group. With
group members being remembered through a firebase database of users and admins.
